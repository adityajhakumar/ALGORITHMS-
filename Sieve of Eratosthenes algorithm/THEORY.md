Sure! The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It is simple yet efficient, making it a great starting point for beginners in understanding algorithms and prime numbers. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Create a List:**
   Start with a list of consecutive integers from 2 to the maximum number `n` you want to check for primality. For example, if `n = 30`, you will have a list like this:
   ```
   2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 30
   ```

2. **Initial Setup:**
   Assume all numbers in the list are prime. We will mark non-prime numbers as we proceed.

3. **Start with the First Prime (2):**
   The first number in the list is 2, which is a prime number. Circle it or mark it as prime. Then, remove or mark all multiples of 2 (greater than 2) as they are not prime. 

   So, we mark 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 30:
   ```
   2, 3, X, 5, X, 7, X, 9, X, 11, ..., X
   ```

4. **Move to the Next Number:**
   The next number in the list that is not marked is 3. This is a prime number. Circle it or mark it as prime. Then, remove or mark all multiples of 3 (greater than 3) as they are not prime.

   So, we mark 6, 9, 12, 15, ..., 30:
   ```
   2, 3, X, 5, X, 7, X, X, X, 11, ..., X
   ```

5. **Continue the Process:**
   Move to the next unmarked number, which is 5. Circle it or mark it as prime. Then, mark all multiples of 5 as non-prime.

   So, we mark 10, 15, 20, 25, ..., 30:
   ```
   2, 3, X, 5, X, 7, X, X, X, 11, X, 13, X, X, 17, X, 19, X, X, 23, X, X, 29, X
   ```

6. **Repeat Until the List is Exhausted:**
   Continue this process for the next unmarked number (7), and so on, until you've processed all numbers up to `sqrt(n)`. 

   For numbers beyond `sqrt(n)`, all non-prime numbers will already have been marked.

7. **Collect All Primes:**
   The numbers that remain unmarked are the prime numbers. In our example, the primes up to 30 are:
   ```
   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
   ```

### Python Implementation



This algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n \log \log n)\) and works well for finding all primes up to a large number.
